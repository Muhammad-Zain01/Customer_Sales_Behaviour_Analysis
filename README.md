# Customer Purchasing Behaviour Analysis
## Problem Statement:-
Conduct analysis on your client's transaction datasets and identify customer purchasing behaviors to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

### LIFESTAGE: 
Customer attribute that identifies whether a customer has a family or not and what point in life they are at e.g. are their children in pre-school/primary/secondary school.

### PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: 
Customer segmentation used to differentiate shoppers by the price point of products they buy and the types of products they buy. It is used to identify whether customers may spend more for quality or brand or whether they will purchase the cheapest options.

#### The study of consumer behavior includes:
    • How consumers think and feel about different alternatives (brands, products, services, and retailers)
    • How consumers reason and select between different alternatives
    • The behavior of consumers while researching and shopping
    • How consumer behavior is influenced by their environment (peers, culture, media)
    • How marketing campaigns can be adapted and improved to more effectively influence the consumer
#### These considerations are influenced by three factors:
##### Personal factors:- 
A person’s interests and opinions. These will be affected by demographics such as age, gender, culture, profession, background and so on.
Psychological factors – Everybody’s response to a particular marketing campaign will be based on their perceptions and attitudes. A person’s ability to comprehend information, their perception of their need, their attitude, will all play a part.
##### Social factors:-  
Peer groups, from family and friends to social media influence. This factor also includes social class, income, and education level.
